# 1. HTTP Verbs
- **Question**: What are the main HTTP verbs and in what situations are each used?
  - **Answer**: The main HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, and HEAD.
    - GET is used to retrieve data from the server.
    - POST is used to send data to the server, usually to create a new resource.
    - PUT updates an existing resource.
    - DELETE removes a resource.
    - PATCH applies partial modifications to a resource.
    - OPTIONS returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for a specific resource.
    - HEAD is similar to GET but only requests the headers of the response.

- **Question**: How would you handle the different types of responses that HTTP verbs can return in an API?
  - **Answer**: HTTP responses are handled using status codes. For example:
    - 200 OK: indicates a successful operation.
    - 201 Created: confirms the creation of a resource.
    - 204 No Content: indicates success with no response content, usually for DELETE.
    - 400 Bad Request: indicates that the request is incorrect.
    - 401 Unauthorized: indicates lack of authentication.
    - 403 Forbidden: the request is valid but lacks permissions.
    - 404 Not Found: the resource was not found.
    - 500 Internal Server Error: indicates a server-side error.

# 2. Software Development Principles
- **Question**: Can you explain the four fundamental principles of software development and how you apply them in your daily work?
  - **Answer**: The four principles include modularity, abstraction, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. They are applied by:
    - Modularizing code to facilitate reuse and maintenance.
    - Using abstraction to simplify handling complex data.
    - Encapsulating internal object details to maintain data integrity.
    - Separating responsibilities to ensure a single component doesn’t handle multiple tasks.

- **Question**: How do you apply the SOLID principles in the design of your backend applications?
  - **Answer**: SOLID is a set of principles guiding object-oriented design:
    - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each class should have a single responsibility.
    - **O**pen/Closed Principle: Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a derived class should be substitutable for objects of their base class.
    - **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    - **D**ependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

# 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Question**: What are the four principles of object-oriented programming and how do you implement them in C#?
  - **Answer**: The four principles are:
    - **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary.
    - **Abstraction**: Defining a common interface for a set of related functionalities.
    - **Inheritance**: Allowing one class to inherit characteristics from another.
    - **Polymorphism**: Allowing an operation to be performed in different ways depending on the object.

- **Question**: How do you implement the repository pattern and the unit of work pattern in a backend project?
  - **Answer**: The repository pattern centralizes data access logic, while the unit of work pattern ensures that all data operations in a transaction complete successfully. In .NET Core, they can be implemented using interfaces and concrete classes that handle data access via Entity Framework.

# 4. Dependency Injection
- **Question**: What is dependency injection and how does it improve code maintainability?
  - **Answer**: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows dependencies to be injected into a class instead of the class creating them itself. This improves maintainability by making classes easier to test and modify.

- **Question**: What is the difference between Singleton, Transient, and Scoped lifetimes in .NET Core?
  - **Answer**:
    - **Singleton**: Creates a single instance of the class that is shared throughout the application.
    - **Transient**: Creates a new instance of the class every time it is requested.
    - **Scoped**: Creates an instance per request (scope), usually in the context of an HTTP request.

# 5. Entity Framework
- **Question**: What is Entity Framework and how are DbContext, DbSet, and Entity Classes related?
  - **Answer**: Entity Framework (EF) is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that allows you to work with a database using C# objects.
    - **DbContext** is the main class that coordinates EF functionality.
    - **DbSet** represents a collection of entities of a specific type that can be queried or written to.
    - **Entity Classes** are the classes that represent the database tables.

- **Question**: How would you implement Code First and manage migrations in a project using Entity Framework?
  - **Answer**: Code First in EF involves defining classes and relationships in code, then generating the database from them. Migrations allow applying schema changes to the database as the classes evolve.

# 6. SQL Server
- **Question**: How would you optimize a complex SQL query to improve performance in SQL Server?
  - **Answer**: Optimizing a SQL query can involve:
    - Using appropriate indexes.
    - Simplifying queries.
    - Avoiding costly operations like functions on columns with large data volumes.
    - Using tools like the execution plan to identify bottlenecks.

- **Question**: What are stored procedures, functions, and views, and when should you use them?
  - **Answer**:
    - **Stored Procedures**: Blocks of SQL code that perform a specific operation and are stored on the server for reuse.
    - **Functions**: Similar to stored procedures but can return a value and be used in queries.
    - **Views**: Predefined queries stored on the server that act as virtual tables.

# 7. Microservices
- **Question**: How would you design a microservices architecture for a backend application?
  - **Answer**: Microservices architecture divides an application into small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

- **Question**: What communication and error-handling patterns would you use in a microservices environment?
  - **Answer**: Common patterns include using message queues for asynchronous communication and circuit breakers to handle errors and prevent failure cascades to other services.

# 8. Collections and Delegates
- **Question**: What is a collection in C# and what types of collections exist?
  - **Answer**: A collection is a data structure that stores objects. Types of collections include lists (List<T>), dictionaries (Dictionary<TKey, TValue>), queues (Queue<T>), and stacks (Stack<T>).

- **Question**: What is a delegate in C# and how is it used in application development?
  - **Answer**: A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a specific parameter and return type. They are useful for implementing design patterns like Observer or for passing methods as parameters to other functions.
